# [Travelr](https://travelr-614.herokuapp.com/)
A simple travel list app allows users to sign in and create a list of destinations they would like to travel to along with notes about the destination. A destination can be crossed off, edited, or removed entirely from the list.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** CSS, Express, HTML, JavaScript, MongoDB, node.js
**Packages/Dependencies used:** bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

Travelr was built using the MVC Architecture. We have also implemented "authorization" so users can sign up, customize & personalize the app.

## Optimizations

In the future, we would like to make the following additions:
- Add a CSS framework like Bootstrap for styling
- Enable users to add a trip date to their destinations list and sort their lists by that date
- Move destinations that are crossed off to a separate "Traveled To" list
- Allow users to see destination lists from other users
